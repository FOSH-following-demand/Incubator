Brief summary of the progress made, learnings, and way forward in keywords by week

#### Week1
We have made a list of similar DIY incubator projects. In addition to this, Andre sent us several links to other incubator projects.  

#### Week 2
We did a reseach on What material to use for the frame (wood, metal, which metal - should be low-cost and durable). Finally we come out with this comparative table and we decide to use the cooler box.

#### Week 3
The team was so glad to found local suppliers selling all what we need here in Cameroon: DBL electronics and Megatec

#### Week4
This week was so productive, we focus our efforts on electronics: 
- First of all, we decided on what we want our incubator will be able to do. Specifically, we want to be able to fixe the desired temperature with a potentiometer and bring the incubator at this temperature.  
- We had an issue on the cooling system of the incubator. Fan VS Peltier elements. Finally we choose the Peltier element
- We bought the required electronics
- Ariel from Ongola Fablab, helps us with the Arduino code and all looks great
