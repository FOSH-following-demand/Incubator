- Incubator is working well, will test with yoghurt making tomorrow.
- Will complete info on local suppliers this week, with the link Andre provided
- Will upload arduino code and the laser cut patterns to the repo

The team wants to try making the shaker, as it's very easy and they have the materials, will take one or two days.

In terms of usability and democratization, next step is producing a "KossamTor" - An incubator for Kossam (yoghurt), that will be installed in the village for people to produce yoghurt. Presentation will be 3rd july, during MboaLab opendoors day. For this, the team will make a video and short instructions, for people that don't use GitHub (most of them).

Will try to buy stuff asap so to send Andre the invoices before 24th.

Note taker: Julieta

1- Updates on development of the prototype     
- Assembled 1st version of incubator and it works!
- You can actually choose temperature :D

2- Document for the user
- BoM ready with $ (check hw folder BoM)
- Send information for contributing to map of suppliers --> Possible output of BFOSH: map with suppliers

3- Next
- Let's complete the docs: hw/datasheets, software: the code, readme file: steps to build it, steps to use it, any lesson learned, specifics people need to know to replicate the incubator??
- Test incubator by making yoghurt!


Next call: June 20th

Note taker: Julieta

1- Updates on development of the prototype     
- Tested how long the chamber can keep hot water -- document this test! Maybe a journal can help, so documentation is not done at the end of the project (it's a pain and we tend to document only success)
- Started coding with Arduino IDE based on Biohack Academy's code combined with Richard Boman's incubator (biomakers challenge)
- Still working on the code, will upload 1st version soon

2- Program schedule, week 3: BoM, dev plan     
- Materials: goal is to get everything locally. Got sensors in mboa lab, but trying to source them locally (in progress). 
- Get BoM & simple dev plan, will 

3- Difficulties      
- Still learning github - Julieta will record & send video tutorial 

Next call: June 13th

Notetaker: Andre

Status:
 - Made document showing different materials other projects used.
 - Decided for the cooler box, since this is already built and has been optimized for holding temperature.
 - They also saw a shop that repairs fridges, maybe using an out of order fridge, might be an option (to be tested later maybe)
 - Found temperature sensor kits and Arduino at Mboalab. 

Questions:

 - how to test the incubator to know that it is working? and how can people building it will know that their built is working? (testing and calibration).
 - Would it be possible to log the data? Register the temperature being read by the arduino in a file, so that the data can be plotted later.
 
 
before next meeting:
 
 - Write down a BOM and Document! https://github.com/FOSH-following-demand/Incubator/blob/master/hardware/BOM/BOM.md

Next meeting:

- Agenda:  
 
 -- check how the building of the first prototype is going, see if there are any problems.   
 -- If things are already working properly, think about testing/calibrating and writing a manual for other people to build.

Status quo on the project:

Questions: What material to use for the frame - wood, metal, which metal - should be low-cost and durable.
Options: impregnated wood or insulated with styrophome
