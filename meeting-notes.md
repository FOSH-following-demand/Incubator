## May 30, 2019

Notetaker: Andre

Status:
 - Made document showing different materials other projects used.
 - Decided for the cooler box, since this is already built and has been optimized for holding temperature.
 - They also saw a shop that repairs fridges, maybe using an out of order fridge, might be an option (to be tested later maybe)
 - Found temperature sensor kits and Arduino at Mboalab. 

Questions:

 - how to test the incubator to know that it is working? and how can people building it will know that their built is working? (testing and calibration).
 - Would it be possible to log the data? Register the temperature being read by the arduino in a file, so that the data can be plotted later.
 
 
before next meeting:
 - Write down a BOM and Document! https://github.com/FOSH-following-demand/Incubator/blob/master/hardware/BOM/BOM.md

Next meeting:

- Agenda:
 
 -- check how the building of the first prototype is going, see if there are any problems.
 -- If things are already working properly, think about testing/calibrating and writing a manual for other people to build.
