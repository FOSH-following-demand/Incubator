Note taker: Julieta

1- Updates on development of the prototype     
- Assembled 1st version of incubator and it works!
- You can actually choose temperature :D

2- Document for the user
- BoM ready with $ (check hw folder BoM)

3- Next
User documentation, lessons learned, software needed for building, any specifics? 

Next call: June 20th

Note taker: Julieta

1- Updates on development of the prototype     
- Tested how long the chamber can keep hot water -- document this test! Maybe a journal can help, so documentation is not done at the end of the project (it's a pain and we tend to document only success)
- Started coding with Arduino IDE based on Biohack Academy's code combined with Richard Boman's incubator (biomakers challenge)
- Still working on the code, will upload 1st version soon

2- Program schedule, week 3: BoM, dev plan     
- Materials: goal is to get everything locally. Got sensors in mboa lab, but trying to source them locally (in progress). 
- Get BoM & simple dev plan, will 

3- Difficulties      
- Still learning github - Julieta will record & send video tutorial 

Next call: June 13th

## May 30, 2019

Notetaker: Andre

Status:
 - Made document showing different materials other projects used.
 - Decided for the cooler box, since this is already built and has been optimized for holding temperature.
 - They also saw a shop that repairs fridges, maybe using an out of order fridge, might be an option (to be tested later maybe)
 - Found temperature sensor kits and Arduino at Mboalab. 

Questions:

 - how to test the incubator to know that it is working? and how can people building it will know that their built is working? (testing and calibration).
 - Would it be possible to log the data? Register the temperature being read by the arduino in a file, so that the data can be plotted later.
 
 
before next meeting:
 
 - Write down a BOM and Document! https://github.com/FOSH-following-demand/Incubator/blob/master/hardware/BOM/BOM.md

Next meeting:

- Agenda:  
 
 -- check how the building of the first prototype is going, see if there are any problems.   
 -- If things are already working properly, think about testing/calibrating and writing a manual for other people to build.

Status quo on the project:

Questions: What material to use for the frame - wood, metal, which metal - should be low-cost and durable.
Options: impregnated wood or insulated with styrophome

Local suppliers in Yaound√© - add to this list: https://github.com/FOSH-following-demand/local_suppliers/blob/master/electronic_components.csv
