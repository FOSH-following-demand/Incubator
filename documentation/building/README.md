## Getting started with assembly

 - a brief overview of the equipment people are about to build and what kind of knowledge they are expected to have (soldering, programming). Also, is this safe for amateurs/kids? Is it a one person build? How much time does it take on average to build it?
 - Could you add contact information (email, forum, twitter handle) for people to reach out in case something goes wrong?

## Gathering your materials

The list of components can be found in the [Bill of Materials](https://github.com/FOSH-following-demand/Incubator/blob/master/hardware/BOM/BOM.md). You will also need a soldering iron. 


 |part name| function  | quantity  | build step  | obs.  |
 |---|---|---|---|---|
 |LM2596| voltage regulator  | 2  | 3  | these could be substituted by XX  |
 | Nose needle Pliers  | hold components while soldering  | 1  | all steps  | regular pliers would also work  |

3. build steps:
 - Divide this section in as many subparts as you like and try to be as clear as possible. Would someone seeing the whole thing for the first time be able to build it? (it is a good exercise to oversee someone building the equipment using only your written/video/figure instructions)
 - Is a video a better way to instruct people how to use it? try to keep the file size as small as possible without compromising quality. Also reach out to us, as a good idea might be to create a different repository for the video files.

## Last checks before powering up/using for the first time:

 - Double check that parts have been soldered in the proper orientation.
 - Use a separate thermometer to verify that the temperature is reaching the correct point and is maintained.
