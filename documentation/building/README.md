## Getting started with assembly

This equipment is an incubator, designed to keep the contents at a constant temperature above the ambient temperature. It is an insulated box (a cooler box) that contains a heater (lightbulb), a temperature sensor and some electronics and software that will control the temperature to keep it constant at the level input by the user.

The primary use case is microbiology. It is essential for many protocols to have optimal growth temperature for important microrganisms such as _Escherichia coli_ bacteria. However, mst biology labs in Cameroon and elsewhere in resource-constrained contexts are under-equipped due to the high cost of lab equipment. Other use cases include a drying chamber and a yoghurt maker.

To build the device you will need to undertake some basic soldering and load software onto an Arduino Uno microcontroller but you do not need to have prior experience as there are many tutorials and guides online. This build could be completed by one person in less than a day with all materials and facilities available.

## Build Steps

### Assembling the electronics

### Constructing the electronics enclosure

### Integrating the electronics with the cooler box

### Checking that it works

 - Use a separate thermometer to verify that the temperature is reaching the correct point and is maintained.
