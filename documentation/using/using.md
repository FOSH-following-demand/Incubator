## DIY Incubator Operation Manual

### Installation and Setup 

The DIY incubator is top-opened. The latter should be placed on a low-level surface to facilitate handling and use.

1. Make sure that the incubator is off and plug-in the power cable on normal sector current (220V-240V);
 
2. Switch on the device using the power button located at the level of the control box. (The incandescent bulb within the incubator should light up and information about the temperature inside the cooler box should be displayed on the LCD screen);

3. Place desired items inside the cooler box; (While placing items in the cooler box, care must be taken to avoid direct contact with the incandescent bulb).
 
4. Close the lid of the cooler box;
 
5. Use the potentiometer (rotary button) of the electronic control box to input the desired temperature. 
*(The light bulb will stay on until the desired temperature is obtained inside the cooler box; Once the desired temperature is obtained, the incandescent bulb will then start to continuously come on and off to regulate and maintain the temperature stable inside the cooler box).*
 
6. To stop the incubator, switch off the power button. 
*(No program option to time the incubation is currently available, Use an external timer during operation).*

### Handling routine:
The DIY incubator should be thoroughly disinfected and cleaned before and after each incubation.

### Features:
The device has an auto-resume function (in case of power outage, the incubation will automatically continue as soon as current is back with set conditions maintained without any external internvention needed);

### Troubleshooting:
a.  The LCD screen is on but the incandescent bulb doesnâ€™t turn on:
1.  replace the bulb;
2.  replace the bulb holder;
3.  replace the I2C relay module
