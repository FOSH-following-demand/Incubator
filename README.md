# Incubator

MboaLab in Cameroon were awarded a $750 grant by the Build Free and Open Science Hardware Project led by Andre Chagas and supported by the Mozilla Foundation to build a low-cost, open-source incubator for microbiology. Most biology labs in Cameroon and elsewhere in resource-constrained contexts are under-equipped due to the high cost of lab equipment and it is essential for many protocols including open enzyme manufacturing to have optimal growth temperature for important microrganisms such as Escherichia coli bacteria. We believe that DIY and Open Science Hardware can facilitate access to low-cost and high-quality equipment for biology labs in Cameroon, Ghana and beyond. 

All resources are openly licensed and linked below. Future plans include the inclusion of orbital shaking which increases aeration of cultures and therefore the yield of micro-organisms and their products like proteins.
