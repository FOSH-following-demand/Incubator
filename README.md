# Incubator

MboaLab in Cameroon were awarded a $750 grant by the Build Free and Open Science Hardware Project led by Andre Chagas and supported by the Mozilla Foundation to build a low-cost, open-source incubator for microbiology.

**Why an incubator?**
Most biology labs in Cameroon and elsewhere in resource-constrained contexts are under-equipped due to the high cost of lab equipment and it is essential for many protocols including open enzyme manufacturing to have optimal growth temperature for important microrganisms such as _Escherichia coli_ bacteria. 

**Why opn hardware?**
We believe that DIY and Open Science Hardware can facilitate access to low-cost and high-quality equipment for biology labs in Cameroon, Ghana and beyond.
